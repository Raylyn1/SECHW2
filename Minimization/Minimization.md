# Minimization
## Good Code
The code does not allow the user to give the ID for the person. This way, only the Name data is a viable means of attack.

## Bad Code
Since the user is allowed to set their own ID, this could lead to many user mistakes, and allows for a new attack angle for an attacker since the ID may be used as another way to find a user.
