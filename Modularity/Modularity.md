# Modularity
## Good Code
By using a separate class, the Person object can be taken out, or used in another program without changing the underlying structure of the program. In other words, modifying the Person object will not necessarily effect what is written in main.

## Bad Code
Without the class, all of the code would need to be rearranged, and variables would need to be modfied to accomidate new or changing functionality.
