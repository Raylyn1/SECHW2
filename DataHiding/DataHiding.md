# Data Hiding
## Good Code
In this code, the Person class contains all of the information about the person, but in order to access the data, on must use one of the functions to display the user's name rather than being able to see and modify the data directly.

## Bad Code
This code shows how all of the data is stored in a vector, and can be easily accessed in the main function. This means that the data can be easily changed.
