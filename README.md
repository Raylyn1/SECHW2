Assignment: Describe each of the ten security topics listed below, and give an example of good and bad implementations of each of these concepts.

### **Domain Separation** 
This practice involves keeping data in different locations if the data is unrelated.

### **Process Isolation**
Each process should run independently of any other process in mememory. 

### **Resource Encapsulation**
Only allows certain necessary functions to be done, and only the necessary data can be accessed by these functions.

### **Least Privilege**
This means making sure that each process only has the permissions it needs in order to complete its task.

### **Modularity**
Each process should be able to function independently of every other function. 

### **Layering**
Important data should have multiple security implementations that need to be overcome sequentially

### **Abstraction**
A process should only be aware of the functions that help it to complete a task, but not any extraneous functions or implementation details.

### **Data Hiding**
Keep information and underlying data structures hidden.

### **Simplicity**
With a simpler product, its easier and more secure to update the product.

### **Minimization**
Reduce the number of ways an attacker can gather data.
